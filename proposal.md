`5` Create (3-5) User Stories for the base user experience - ( [Reference](https://revelry.co/resources/development/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) )

1. As a movie buff, i want a platform people can go to look at people's top 5 movies to get inspired and/or try something out of their comfort zone

2. As a movie enthusiast, i want a place where people can post their categorized top 5 movies so other people can comment on what they thought 


3. Instead of scrolling mindlessly through netflix/prime i would love to look at my friends top 5 movies to see what they like and have more to talk about later.


4. Instead of looking for a movie for hours, my friends can show me what their top 5 favorite movies of all time is at POWER LIST.

`7` Find API and test to see if you can get data ( *be able to print data in the console using Axios, Node-Fetch, and/or Postman* )
